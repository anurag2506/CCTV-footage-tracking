<h1> CCTV Footage Tracking and Classification</h1> <br>

<h3> Description: </h3> 
<p> This project focusses on taking in any form of video input, can be a live CCTV source from RTPC url, or a pre-recorded video and classify the people in the screen as either <b>Wearing Coats</b> and <b>Not Wearing Coats</b>. The classification is done in real time and classifies the person in the frame into one of two classes </p>

<p> The entire pipeline can be thought of 3 main processes: <br> <h4>1. Object Detection for the human beings in the frame </h4> <h4>2. The tracking of the detected objects through all the frames in the video</h4><h4>3. The classification of the detected objects as either 'wearing a coat' or 'not wearing a coat' </h4></p><br><br>
